## Notes

Definetly the configuration function. The API call was straightforward as I led my Lab last week so I knew how to do it, but some errors for configuring was question index being out of range and disortion of the words. Also, I reconfigured showFinalScore(), to call another API set so the user can have fresh new questions after a restard.
